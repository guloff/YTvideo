This Python script utilizes `yt-dlp`, a command-line program to enable users to download videos from YouTube in their preferred format. The script provides a simple interface where users can input a YouTube video link, then displays all available download formats for that video, including details such as format code, file extension, resolution, and any additional notes related to the format. Users can then select their desired format code to initiate the download process. The video is saved in the same directory as the script, with the filename including the video title and chosen format code. This tool is especially useful for those looking to download videos for offline viewing, archival purposes, or content creation, offering flexibility in terms of video quality and format.

### Features:
- **Easy to Use**: Just run the script, input a YouTube video URL, and choose your desired format.
- **Flexible Download Options**: Lists all available formats, including resolutions and file types, allowing for a customized download experience.
- **Convenient File Naming**: Saves videos with a filename that includes the video title and selected format code, making files easy to identify.

### How to Use:
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install `yt-dlp` using pip: `pip install yt-dlp`.
3. Run the script: `python download_youtube_video.py`.
4. Follow the on-screen prompts to enter a YouTube video link and select a download format.

This script is meant for educational purposes and personal use. Users are responsible for adhering to YouTube's terms of service and copyright laws regarding content downloading.
